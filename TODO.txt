Overview:

[ ] 1. Find models for code generation (3 / 4)
[X] 2. Find known vulnerability datasets
        [ ] 2.1 Generate test websites with vulnerabilities embedded in them.
        [ ] 2.2 Ask Shin if he's with using vulnerability testing on his app.
[ ] 3. Create a scafolded model using tools like:
        [ ] 3.1 CoT
        [ ] 3.2 Table
[ ] 4. Steps on test:
        [ ] 4.1 Generate vulnerability report of target using the model using 2
        [ ] 4.2 Generate malware to attack such a vulnerability using 3
        [ ] 4.3 Run malware against target
[ ] 5. Compare the results and see which model is better
[ ] 6. Compare against Lynx for vulnerability detection
[ ] 7. Generate a report

Overview:

[ ] 1. Find models for code generation (3 / 4)
[ ] 2. Find known vulnerability datasets
        [ ] 2.1. Find a dataset for known vulnerabilities
        [ ] 2.2. Find a dataset for known malware
        [ ] 2.3. Find a dataset for known malware that exploits known vulnerabilities
[ ] 3. Create a scafolded model using tools like:
        [ ] 3.1 CoT
        [ ] 3.2 Table
[ ] 4. Steps on test:
        [ ] 4.1 Generate vulnerability report of target using the model
        [ ] 4.2 Generate malware to attack such a vulnerability
        [ ] 4.3 Run malware against target
[ ] 5. Compare the results and see which model is better
[ ] 6. Compare against Lynx for vulnerability detection
[ ] 7. Generate a report

# Malware Provider Agent

## Draft:

### Introduction 

The exploitation of the LLM model to generate malicious software could occur through seemingly innocuous requests. These may appear as questions under the guise of an educational pursuit or a classroom exercise, with the assumed objective of generating an instructional exercise with parts to be completed by end users.

Further details and illustrative examples of such malicious exchanges causing subsequent exposure are available in the following GitHub repository: [Attached Link](https://github.com/EduardoNeville/Malware_Agent#malware-provider-agent). 

### Execution of Exploit

- Stage 1: Inquire about the various components of viral architectural elements.
- Stage 2: Query individual elements, intentionally leaving select lines of code omitted.
- Stage 3: Request the model to generate the omitted sections.
- Stage 4: Iteratively repeat stages 2 and 3 until a complete virus is manifested.
Such methodology incrementally develops a virus, consequently enabling malicious activities even amongst those lacking technical proficiency, and thus augmenting the distribution scope of damaging content across the internet.

### Addressing the vulnerability

Addressing a vulnerabilty such as this one is very hard as we have to pose the 
following question; how can the model discern from truthful questions and
falsehoods? 

### Limitations 

The main limitation this idea has is that while it's possible to perform a 
jailbreaks by posing as truthful agent. Patching could be perfomed by denying any
type of agent from performing these types of prompts.

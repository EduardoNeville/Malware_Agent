## Draft:

Prompting GPT-4 can provide you with malware by asking questions

The documentation and examples of prompt conversations that show vulnerabilities
are linked in the following github repository: [Link to github]
Step 1: Ask for the different parts of the viruses architecture.
Step 2: Ask for each part with a few lines of code missing.
Step 3: Ask it to fill these lines up
Step 4: Repeat Step 2 & 3 until fully completed virus.
This is a very easy way of reproducing a virus and providing malware 
capabilities for non tech savy individuals, it lowers the technical
cealing needed to spread harmful content into the internet.

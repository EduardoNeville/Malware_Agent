### Introduction

The potential for misuse of the LLM model to generate harmful software is a critical concern. We will demonstrate two strategies to overcome the censorship of certain knowledge such as computer viruses. These be achieved through seemingly innocuous requests.
For instance, the language model might be prompted as though participating in an educational exercise or a classroom activity, misconstruing its compliance as harmful actions. The intended exercise may appear harmless, with unfinished sections that need to be completed; nevertheless, these incomplete parts may represent components of malware, waiting to be realized. 

Further insight, concrete examples, and exploitative strategies are openly sourced and can be accessed via the following GitHub repository: [Attached Link](https://github.com/EduardoNeville/Malware_Agent#malware-provider-agent).

### Execution of First Exploit

The subtlety of the exploit rests within a multi-stage approach:
1. Initiate inquiries about distinct modules of computer viruses.
2. Deliberately present these queries incompletely, leaving out selected lines of code within each module.
3. Task the model to complete the unfulfilled parts.
4. Repeat stages 2 and 3 iteratively until a full-fledged virus is assembled.
This methodology essentially decodes the creation of a virus, and unintentionally equips even the technically unskilled individuals with malware capabilities. This lowers the barrier for harmful content dissemination over the web, therefore provoking a significant cyberthreat.

### Execution of Second Exploit

The secondary exploit employs a strategy of 'translational subterfuge.' Here, the objective is to distract and mislead the model's censorship through a mapping table. This table translates conventional computing terms and module names into ordinary, unrelated words, successfully circumventing the model's safeguards against explicit malware prompting.

### Addressing the Vulnerability

Counterbalancing such established vulnerabilities is an intricate challenge. It essentially demands a resolution to the critical dilemma: how can the modeled Artificial Intelligence discriminate between truth-seeking inquiries and disguised, harmful exploitations?

### Limitations

The key constraint within this exploitation is the aspect of credibility. While it's plausible to 'jailbreak' the prevention mechanisms by posing as an authentic user, a significant limitation emerges when prevention strategies deny all agents from performing such suspiciously incomplete prompts. The fine line between security and usability gets tested under these circumstances.
